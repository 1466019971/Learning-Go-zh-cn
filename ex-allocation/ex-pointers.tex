\Question
What is the difference between the following two allocations?
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
func Set(t *T) {
    x = t
}
\end{lstlisting}
and
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
func Set(t T) {
    x= &t
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question
In the second function, \var{x} points to a new
(heap-allocated) variable \var{t} which contains
a copy of whatever the actual argument value is.

In the first function, \var{x} points to the same thing
that \var{t} does, which is the same thing that the actual
argument points to.

So in the second function, we have an "extra" variable
containing a copy of the interesting value.
\end{Answer}
