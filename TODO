the go-nuts mailing list the other day. I believe that there are a few
minor inaccuracies in the Origins section. The Inferno operating
system included the Limbo language, not Plan 9. Furthermore, Limbo
compiles to bytecode and so, when you mention the support for cross
compiling, I believe you mean the Plan 9 compiler tools (which also
are the inspiration for the [568][acgl] names of the tools that form
the compiler chain). I imagine that the Alef programming language
(which was exclusive to Plan 9) should probably appear in there
somewhere.

Also, the diagram of the chronology of Go includes Ken Thompson's
birthdate but omits those of other key people such as Rob Pike, to
name but one.

I hope you take this criticism in the spirit in which it is intended:
to make a good book better.
