\noindent{}In this chapter we are going to look at the building blocks in Go for 
communicating with the outside world.

\section{Files}
Reading from (and writing to) files is easy in Go. This program
only uses the \package{os} package to read data from the file \file{/etc/passwd}.
\lstinputlisting[caption=Reading from a file (unbufferd),label=src:read]{src/file.go}
\showremarks
If you want to use \first{buffered}{buffered} IO there is the
\package{bufio}\index{package!bufio} package:
\lstinputlisting[caption=Reading from a file (bufferd),label=src:bufread]{src/buffile.go}
\showremarks

\subsection{Line by line}
The previous program reads a file in its entirely, but a more common scenario is that
you want to read a file on a line-by-line basis. The following snippet show a way
to do just that:

\begin{lstlisting}
f, _ := os.Open("/etc/passwd")
defer f.Close()
r := bufio.NewReader(f)
s, ok := r.ReadString('\n')     |\coderemark{Read a line from the input}|
// ... \coderemark{\var{s} holds the string, with the \package{strings} package you can parse it}
\end{lstlisting}

A more robust method (but slightly more complicated) is \func{ReadLine}, see the documentation
of the \package{bufio} package.

\section{Command line arguments}
\label{sec:option parsing}
Arguments from the command line are available inside your program via
the string slice \var{os.Args}, provided you have imported the package
\package{os}. The \package{flag} package has a more sophisticated
interface, and also provides a way to parse flags. Take this example
from a DNS query tool:
\begin{lstlisting}
dnssec := flag.Bool("dnssec", false, "Request DNSSEC records") |\longremark{Define a \texttt{bool} flag, %%
\texttt{-dnssec}. The variable must be a pointer otherwise the package can not set its value;}|
port := flag.String("port", "53", "Set the query port")      |\longremark{Idem, but for a \texttt{port} option;}|
flag.Usage = func() {   |\longremark{Slightly redefine the \func{Usage} function, to be a little more verbose;}|
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Usage: %s [OPTIONS] [name ...]\n", os.Args[0])
    flag.PrintDefaults() |\longremark{For every flag given, \func{PrintDefaults} will output the help string;}|
}
flag.Parse()   |\longremark{Parse the flags and fill the variables.}|
\end{lstlisting}
\showremarks

\section{Executing commands}
The \package{exec}\index{package!exec} package has functions to run external commands, and it the premier way to
execute commands from within a Go program. It works by defining a \var{*exec.Cmd} structure for which it
defines a number of methods.
Lets execute \verb|ls -l|:
\begin{lstlisting}
import "exec"

cmd := exec.Command("/bin/ls", "-l")    |\coderemark{Create a \var{*cmd}}|
err := cmd.Run()                        |\coderemark{\func{Run()} it}|
\end{lstlisting}
Capturing standard output from a command is also easy to do:
\begin{lstlisting}
import "exec"

cmd := exec.Command("/bin/ls", "-l")
buf, err := cmd.Ouput()                 |\coderemark{\var{buf} is a (\type{[]byte})}|
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Networking}
All network related types and functions can be found in the package \package{net}. One of the
most important functions in there is \func{Dial}\index{networking!Dial}. When you \func{Dial}
into a remote system the function returns a \var{Conn} interface type, which can be used
to send and receive information. The function \func{Dial} neatly abstracts away the network
family and transport. So IPv4 or IPv6, TCP or UDP can all share a common interface. 

Dialing a remote system (port 80) over TCP, then UDP and lastly TCP over IPv6 looks
like this:\footnote{In case
you are wondering, 192.0.32.10 and 2620:0:2d0:200::10 are \url{www.example.org}.}
\begin{lstlisting}
conn, err := Dial("tcp", "192.0.32.10:80")
conn, err := Dial("udp", "192.0.32.10:80")
conn, err := Dial("tcp", "[2620:0:2d0:200::10]:80") |\coderemark{Brackets are mandatory}|
\end{lstlisting}

And with \var{conn} you can do read/write \todo{dkls}.
