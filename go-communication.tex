to sleep after.}{\textsc{ANNE MORROW LINDBERGH}}
\noindent{}In this chapter we are going to look at the building blocks in Go for 
communicating with the outside world.

\section{Files}
Reading from (and writing to) files is easy in Go. This program
only uses the \package{os} package to read data from the file \file{/etc/passwd}.
\lstinputlisting[numbers=right,caption=Reading from a file (unbufferd),label=src:read]{src/file.go}
If you want to use \first{buffered}{buffered} IO there is the
\package{bufio}\index{package!bufio} package:
\lstinputlisting[numbers=right,caption=Reading from a file (bufferd),label=src:bufread]{src/buffile.go}

On line 12 we create a \type{bufio.Reader} from \var{f} which is of
type \type{*File}. \func{NewReader} expects an \type{io.Reader}, so you
might think this will fail. But it doesn't. An \type{io.Reader} is
defined as:
\begin{lstlisting}
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err os.Error)
}
\end{lstlisting}
So \emph{anything} that has such a \func{Read()} function implements this
interface. And from listing \ref{src:read} (line 10) we can see
that \type{*File} indeed does so. 

\section{Command line arguments}
Arguments from the command line are available inside your program via
the string slice \var{os.Args}, provided you have imported the package
\package{os}. The \package{flag} package has a more sophisticated
interface, and also provided a way to parse flags.
\todo{example.}

\section{Executing commands}
The \package{exec}\index{package!exec} package has function to run external commands, and it the premier way to
execute commands from within a Go program. We start commands with 
the \func{Run} function:
\begin{lstlisting}
func Run(argv0 string, argv, envv []string, dir string, stdin, stdout, stderr int) (p *Cmd, err os.Error)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{quote}
Run starts the binary prog running with
arguments \var{argv} and environment \var{envv}.
It returns a pointer to a new \type{Cmd} representing the command or an error.
\end{quote}
Lets execute \verb|ls -l|:
\begin{lstlisting}
import "exec"

cmd, err := exec.Run("/bin/ls", []string{"ls", "-l"}, nil, "", exec.DevNull, exec.DevNull, exec.DevNull)
\end{lstlisting}
In the \package{os}\index{package!os} package we find the \func{ForkExec} function. This
is another way (but more low level) to start executables.\footnote{There is talk on
the go-nuts mailing list about separating \func{Fork} and
\func{Exec}.} 
The prototype for \func{ForkExec} is:
\begin{lstlisting}
func ForkExec(argv0 string, argv []string, envv []string, dir string, fd []*File) (pid int, err Error)
\end{lstlisting}
With the following documentation:
\begin{quote}
\func{ForkExec} forks the current process and invokes \func{Exec} with the
file, arguments, and environment specified by \var{argv0}, \var{argv}, and
\var{envv}. It returns the process id of the forked process and an
\type{Error}, if any. The \var{fd} array specifies the file descriptors to be
set up in the new process: \var{fd[0]} will be Unix file descriptor 0 (standard
input), \var{fd[1]} descriptor 1, and so on.  A \var{nil} entry will cause the
child to have no open file descriptor with that index.  If \var{dir} is not
empty, the child chdirs into the directory before execing the program.
\end{quote}
Suppose we want to execute \verb|ls -l| again:
\begin{lstlisting}
import "os"

pid, err := os.ForkExec("/bin/ls", []string{"ls", "-l"}, nil, "", []*os.File{ os.Stdin, os.Stdout, os.Stderr})
defer os.Wait(pid, os.WNOHANG) |\coderemark{Otherwise you create a zombie}|
\end{lstlisting}
