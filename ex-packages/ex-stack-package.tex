\begin{Exercise}[title={Stack as package},difficulty=2]
\label{ex:stack-package}
\Question\label{ex:stack-package q1} 
See the Q\ref{ex:stack} exercise. In this exercise we want to create
a separate package for that code.
Create a proper package for your
stack implementation, \func{Push}, \func{Pop} and the \type{Stack} type need to be
exported.

\Question\label{ex:stack-package q2} Write a simple unit test for this package.
You should at least test that a \func{Pop} works after a \func{Push}.

\Question\label{ex:stack-package q3} Which official Go package could
also be used as a (FIFO) stack?
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question There are a few details that should be changed to make a proper package
for our stack. First, the exported functions should begin with a capital 
letter and so should \type{Stack}. The full package becomes:
\lstinputlisting[caption=Stack in a package]{ex-packages/src/stack-as-package.go}

\Question Unit test answer appears here

\Question That would be the package \package{container/vector}.
\end{Answer}
