\begin{Exercise}[title={Stack as package},difficulty=2]
\label{ex:stack-package}
\Question\label{ex:stack-package q1} 
See the Q\ref{ex:stack} exercise. In this exercise we want to create
a separate package for that code.

Create a proper package for your
stack implementation, \func{Push}, \func{Pop} and the \type{Stack} type need to be
exported.

\Question\label{ex:stack-package q2} Which official Go package could
also be used for a (FIFO) stack?

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question There are a few details that should be changed to make a proper package
for our stack. First, the exported function should begin with a capital 
letter and so should \type{Stack}. So the full package (including the
\func{String}) function becomes
\lstinputlisting[caption=Stack in a
package]{ex-packages/src/stack-as-package.go}

\end{Answer}
