Miek Gieben has a masters in Computer Science from the Radboud University in Nijmegen.
After playing with the language Erlang, Go was the first concurrent language
that actually stuck with him.

He fills his spare time with coding in, and writing of Go. He is the maintainer
of a Go DNS library: \url{https://github.com/miekg/godns}.

He maintains a personal blog on \url{http://www.miek.nl} and tweets
under the name \texttt{@miekg}. The postings and tweets may sometimes 
actually have to do something with Go.
