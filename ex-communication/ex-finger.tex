\Question
Write a finger daemon that works with the finger(1) command. 

From the Debian package description:
\begin{quote}
Fingerd is a simple daemon based on RFC 1196 \cite{RFC1196} that provides an interface to the
``finger'' program at most network sites.  The program is supposed to return a
friendly, human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a
particular person in depth.
\end{quote}

Stick to the basics and only support a username argument. If the user has a \file{.plan} file
show the contents of that file.
