\noindent{}In this chapter we will show off Go's ability for
concurrent programming using channels and goroutines.

what is a goroutine, from \cite{effective_go}:
\begin{quote}
They're called goroutines because the existing terms --- threads, coroutines,
processes, and so on --- convey inaccurate connotations. A goroutine has a simple
model: it is a function executing in parallel with other goroutines in the same
address space. It is lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of
stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow by
allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.
\end{quote}

The following idea for a program was taken from \cite{curso_go}.
\lstinputlisting[numbers=right,label=src:sleeping,caption=Go routines in action,linerange={8,18}]{src/sleep.go}

Problem: don't know how long to wait on line 18.

You need to communicate with the go-routines, this is where channels
come in.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Go routines and a channel,label=src:sleeping with channels]
var c chan int |\longremark{Declare \var{c} to be a variable that is a %
channel of \type{int}s. That is: this channel can move integers;}|

func ready(w string, sec int) {
	time.Sleep(int64(sec) * 1e9)
	fmt.Println(w, "is ready!")
	c <- 1	|\longremark{Send the integer 1 on the channel \var{c};}|
}

func main() {i
	c = make(chan int) |\longremark{Initialize \var{c}, note that we must use \func{make} here;}|
	go ready("Tee", 2) |\longremark{Start the goroutines as usual;}|
	go ready("Coffee", 1)
	fmt.Println("I'm waiting, but not too long")
	<-c |\longremark{Wait until we receive a value from the channel. Note that the value we receive is discarded;}|
	<-c |\longremark{Two goroutines, two values to receive.}|
}
\end{lstlisting}
