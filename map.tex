\begin{Exercise}[title={Map function},difficulty=4]
A \func{map()}-function is a function that takes
a function and a list. The function is applied to 
each member in the list and a new list containing
these calculated values is returned.
Thus: 
$$ map(f(), (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n-1},a_n)) =  (f(a_1), f(a_2),\ldots,f(a_{n-1}), f(a_n)) $$
\Question Write a simple \func{map()}-function in Go. It is sufficient
for this function only to work for \type{int}s.
\Question Expand your code to also work on a list of \type{strings}.
\Question Now make it generic using interfaces.
