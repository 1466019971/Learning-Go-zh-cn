\begin{Exercise}[title={Stack as package},difficulty=2]
\label{ex:stack-package}
\Question\label{ex:stack-package q1} Create a proper package for your
stack implementation, \func{push}, \func{pop} and the \type{stack} type need to be
exported.

\Question\label{ex:stack-package q2} Which official Go package could
also be used for a (FIFO) stack?

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question There are a few details that should be changed to make a proper package
for our stack. First, the exported function should begin with a capital 
letter and so should \type{Stack}. So the full package (including the
\func{String()} function becomes
\lstinputlisting[caption=Stack in a
package]{ex-functions/src/stack-as-package.go}

\Question The \package{container/vector} package would be a could candidate. It
even comes with \func{push} and \func{pop} functions \emph{predefined}.
\end{Answer}
