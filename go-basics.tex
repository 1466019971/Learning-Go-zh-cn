\epi{"There and back again."}{Bilbo Baggins}
\noindent{}There are a few things that make Go different than most other language
out there.
\begin{description}
\item[Clean and Simple]
Go strives to keep things small and beautifull, you should
be able to do impressive things in a few lines of code;
\item[Concurrent]
Go makes it easy to ''fire off'' functions to be
run as \emph{very} lightweight threads. These threads are called
\first{go-routines} in Go;

\item[Channels] 
Communication with these go-routines is done
via \first{channels} \cite{csp}.

\item[Fast]
Compilation is fast and execution as fast. The aim is
to be as fast as C. Compilation time is measured in seconds;

\item[Safe]
Go has garbage collection, no more \func{malloc()} in Go,
the language takes care of this;

\item[Standard format]
A Go program can be formatted in (almost) any way the programmmers want,
\emph{but} an official format exist. The rule is very simple:
The output of the filter \prog{gofmt} \emph{is} the official endorsed
format.

\item[Postfix types]
Types are given \emph{after} the variable name, thus \prog{var a int},
instead of \prog{int a;} as in C;

\item[UTF-8]
UTF-8 is all over the place, in strings
\emph{and} in the program code. Finally you can use \prog{$\Phi$ =
$\Phi$ + 1} in your source code;

\item[Open Source]
The Go license is completely open source, see the file LICENSE in the Go
source code distribution;

\item[Fun]
Programming with Go should be fun again!

\end{description}
It must be said the Erlang \cite{erlang} and Scala \cite{scala} also share some
of the features of Go. Notible differences between Erlang
and Go is that Erlang borders on being a functional language,
where Go is an imperative one. And Erlang is running a virtual
machine, while Go is compiled. 

Scala runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and is thus compiled 
bytecode. Is shares features with both Go and Erlang, but still\ldots
JVM.  Well, on with Go.

\section{Hello World}
\label{sec:hello world}
In the Go tutorial, Go is presented to the world in the typical
manner: letting it print "Hello World" (Heck! Ken Thompson and
Dennis Ritchie started this when they presented the C language in 
the nineteen seventies).
So here it is, ''Hello World'' in Go.

\lstinputlisting[label=src:hello,caption=Hello world]{src/helloworld.go}
As you can see, Go is 100\% UTF-8 capable, you can put any Unicode
glyph in your source - assuming you can type it on your keyboard.
Go supports both the \texttt{\rem{/* */}} and \texttt{\rem{//}} types of comments. 

To explain our "Hello
world"-program, we go through it line by line. In line 1, we state
that this program is part of the \lstinline{package main}. Line 3
tells Go to import the "\package{fmt}" package and make it available
in the Go program under the name \lstinline{fmt}. Packages (see chapter
\ref{chap:packages}) play a large role in Go.
If we had used
\lstinline{import foo "fmt"} we could say \lstinline{foo.Printf}. On
line 5 we define our main function and use the \lstinline{fmt.Printf} to
print our text.

\section{Compiling and running code}
This is a very concise instruction on how to get your code
compiled and get it running.
The shortest program you can write in Go looks like
this:
%%\lstinputlisting[numbers=right,label=src:short,caption=Shortest Go program]{src/short.go}
In which we define the \key{package} \package{main} and supply it with one
function also called \func{main()}. The fully qualified function
name is \func{main.main()}. This is the function that is called
first.  To compile we do the following
\begin{display}
\pr 8g helloworld.go \qquad\qquad\qquad\rem{# compiles to short.8 (for 32 bit Intel)}
\pr 8l -o helloworld helloworld.8 \qquad\rem{# linking stage}
\end{display}
For 64 bit Intel you should use \prog{6g} and \prog{6l}, this will
generate \prog{short.6}.
You can then execute the program \prog{short}, which of course
does absolute nothing
\begin{display}
\pr ./short
\end{display}

After getting this compiled we can run it:
\begin{display}
\pr ./helloworld
\end{display}\texttt{Hello, world; or }%
\begin{math}\kappa\alpha\lambda\eta\mu\acute{\epsilon}\rho\alpha\hspace{1em}\kappa\end{math}%
\'o\begin{math} \sigma\mu\epsilon\end{math}; or \begin{cjk}こんにちは 世界\end{cjk}
\ \newline
\ \newline
In the next sections we will look at the types, keywords, control structures
and other features of our new language. 

\section{Variables, types and keyword}
Go is different than other languages in that the type of a variable
is specified \emph{after} the variable name. So no: 
\lstinline{int a}, but \lstinline{a int}.

\subsection{Nil value}
Go use nil;
newly created variables are assigned the nil value for that type. So
integer get the value zero, strings are set to the empty string, etc.

\subsection{Boolean types}
A boolean type represents the set of Boolean truth values denoted by the
predeclared constants \emph{true} and \emph{false}. The predeclared boolean type is \type{bool}.

\subsection{Numerical types}

Go has the well known types such as \lstinline{int} and
\lstinline{float}. These types have the appropriate length for your
machine. If you want to be explicit about the length you can have
that too with \lstinline{int32}, or \lstinline{uint32}. Note however
that these types are distinct and assigning variables which mix
these types is a compiler error. Like in the following code:

\lstinputlisting[numbers=right,label=src:types,caption=Familiar types are distinct]{src/types.go}
Gives the error on the assignment on line 7:

\noindent\lstinline{types.go:7: cannot use a + a (type int) as type int32 in assignment}

\subsection{Strings}

An important other built in type is \lstinline{string}. Strings in go are
immutable, meaning that, once defined, they can not be changed. For
people coming from C, the following is not legal in Go:
\lstinline{var s string = "hello"; s[0] = 'c'} 
In Go you will need the following

\subsection{Constants}
iota, and more about constants

\subsection{Complex numbers}
\gomarginpar{Complex numbers were added on 18 February 2010. 
\hg{2010-02-18}}
In Go we have native support for complex numbers. If you 
want use them you need a variable of the type \lstinline{complex}. If
you need a precise number of bits you have \lstinline{complex32} and
\lstinline{complex64} for 32 and 64 bits. A small example of using complex numbers:

\lstinline{var c complex = 5i-5}

\subsection{Go keywords}
\begin{table}
\caption{Keywords in Go}
\label{tab:keywords}
\input{tab/keywords.tex}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:keywords} lists all the keywords in Go.
In the following paragraphs and chapters we will explain some of
them. TODO make references from here to chapters where they are
explained.

\section{Built-in functions}
A number of functions in Go are predefined, meaning they already
\gomarginpar{This is list changing (slowly).\hg{2010-02-04}}
exists and you \emph{don't} have to include any package to get
access to them. In the following paragraphs we list the current 
built-in functions. This is copied from \cite{go_spec}.

\paragraph{\func{close} and \func{closes}} are used in
channel closing (see chapter \ref{chap:channels}).

\paragraph{\func{len} and \func{cap}} are the length and the capacity
of a \type{slice} or an \type{array} respectively. Also see
\ref{capacity}.

\paragraph{\func{new}} is used for creating new ... See allocation.

\paragraph{\func{make}} is used for creating new built-in types.

\paragraph{\func{copy}} copy stuff. TODO

\paragraph{\func{panic} and \func{panicln}} used for an elegant \emph{exception} mechanism.

\paragraph{\func{print} and \func{println}} are lowlevel printing
functions that can be used with reverting to the \package{fmt} package.

\section{Control structures}
The control structures of Go are related to those of C but different in
\gomarginpar{This section is from \cite{effective_go}.}
important ways. There is no do or while loop, only a slightly
generalized for; \key{switch} is more flexible; \key{if} and
\key{switch} accept an
optional initialization statement like that of for; and there are new
control structures including a type switch and a multiway communications
multiplexer, select. The syntax is also slightly different: parentheses
are not required and the bodies must always be brace-delimited.

\subsection{If}
In Go a simple if looks like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
if x > 0 {
    return y
}
\end{lstlisting}
Mandatory braces encourage writing simple \key{if} statements on multiple
lines. It's good style to do so anyway, especially when the body
contains a control statement such as a return or break.

Since \key{if} and \key{switch} accept an initialization statement, it's common to
see one used to set up a local variable.

\begin{lstlisting}
if err := file.Chmod(0664); err != nil {
    log.Stderr(err)
    return err
}
\end{lstlisting}
In the Go libraries, you'll find that when an \key{if} statement doesn't flow
into the next statement-that is, the body ends in \key{break},
\key{continue}, \key{goto},
or \key{return}, the unnecessary else is omitted.

\begin{lstlisting}
f, err := os.Open(name, os.O_RDONLY, 0)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
codeUsing(f)
\end{lstlisting}
This is a example of a common situation where code must analyze a
sequence of error possibilities. The code reads well if the successful
flow of control runs down the page, eliminating error cases as they
arise. Since error cases tend to end in \key{return} statements, the resulting
code needs no \key{else} statements.
\begin{lstlisting}
f, err := os.Open(name, os.O_RDONLY, 0)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
d, err := f.Stat()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
codeUsing(f, d)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{For}
The Go \key{for} loop is similar to-but not the same as-C's. It unifies for
and while and there is no do-while. There are three forms, only one of
which has semicolons.
\begin{lstlisting}
// Like a C for
for init; condition; post { }

// Like a C while
for condition { }

// Like a C for(;;)
for { }
\end{lstlisting}
Short declarations make it easy to declare the index variable right in the loop.
\begin{lstlisting}
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    sum += i
}
\end{lstlisting}
If you're looping over an array, slice, string, or map, or reading from
a channel, a \key{range} clause can manage the loop for you.
\begin{lstlisting}
var m map[string]int
sum := 0
for _, value := range m {  // key is unused
    sum += value
}
\end{lstlisting}
For strings, the \key{range} does more work for you, breaking out individual
Unicode characters by parsing the UTF-8 (erroneous encodings consume one
byte and produce the replacement rune U+FFFD). The loop

\begin{lstlisting}
for pos, char := range "a|$\Phi{}$|x" {
    fmt.Printf("character \%c starts at byte position \%d\n", char, pos)
}
\end{lstlisting}
prints
\begin{display}
character a starts at byte position 0
character \begin{math}\Phi\end{math} starts at byte position 1
character x starts at byte position 3
\end{display}
Finally, since Go has no comma operator and ++ and -- are statements not
expressions, if you want to run multiple variables in a for you should
use parallel assignment.
\begin{lstlisting}
// Reverse a
for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Switch}
Go's \key{switch} is more general than C's. The expressions need not be
constants or even integers, the cases are evaluated top to bottom until
a match is found, and if the switch has no expression it switches on
true. It's therefore possible--and idiomatic--to write an if-else-if-else
chain as a \key{switch}.
\begin{lstlisting}
func unhex(c byte) byte {
    switch {
    case '0' <= c && c <= '9':
        return c - '0'
    case 'a' <= c && c <= 'f':
        return c - 'a' + 10
    case 'A' <= c && c <= 'F':
        return c - 'A' + 10
    }
    return 0
}
\end{lstlisting}
There is no automatic fall through, but cases can be presented in comma-separated lists.

\begin{lstlisting}
func shouldEscape(c byte) bool {
    switch c {
    case ' ', '?', '&', '=', '#', '+', '%':
        return true
    }
    return false
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here's a comparison routine for byte arrays that uses two switch statements:

\begin{lstlisting}
// Compare returns an integer comparing the two byte arrays
// lexicographically.
// The result will be 0 if a == b, -1 if a < b, and +1 if a > b
func Compare(a, b []byte) int {
    for i := 0; i < len(a) && i < len(b); i++ {
        switch {
        case a[i] > b[i]:
            return 1
        case a[i] < b[i]:
            return -1
        }
    }
    switch {
    case len(a) < len(b):
        return -1
    case len(a) > len(b):
        return 1
    }
    return 0
}
\end{lstlisting}
A switch can also be used to discover the dynamic type of an interface
variable. Such a type switch\gomarginindex{\emph{type switch}}{type switch} uses 
the syntax of a type assertion with the keyword type inside the
parentheses. If the switch declares a variable in the expression, the
variable will have the corresponding type in each clause.

\begin{lstlisting}
switch t := interfaceValue.(type) {
default:
    fmt.Printf("unexpected type %T", t)  // %T prints type
case bool:
    fmt.Printf("boolean %t\n", t)
case int:
    fmt.Printf("integer %d\n", t)
case *bool:
    fmt.Printf("pointer to boolean %t\n", *t)
case *int:
    fmt.Printf("pointer to integer %d\n", *t)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Arrays, slices and  maps}
From \cite{go_intro} ... really Good \draft{}
%
arrays, even if it doesn't have any other parametric types? And we really want
these cool things called slices - but they really need to be strongly typed. So
we'll let them be parametric. And maps - we really need a map type, which maps
keys to values, and it really needs to be type-safe. So we'll add a parametric
map type to the language, by making it a special case built-in.

So: you can't write parametric types - but they can. And that creates a very
weird asymmetry to the language. Everything in Go is passed by value - except
for the built-in slice and map types, which are passed by reference. Everything
is allocated by "new" - except for the built-in slice and map types, which are
allocated by "make". It's by far the biggest blemish in Go, and it's absolutely
infuriating.

\subsection{Arrays}
Array types like \lstinline{[10]int} have a fixed size. 
It can't grow, because then it would have a different type. Also array
are values: Assigning one array to another copies all the elements.

In particular, if you pass an array to a function, it will receive a
copy of the array, not a pointer to it. This is a major difference with
C.

To declare an array you can use the following: \lstinline{var a [3]int},
to initialize it to something else than zero, use a composite literal.
\gomarginindex{composite literals}{composite literals}\lstinline|a := [3]int{1, 2, 3}| and
this can be shortend to \lstinline|a := []int{1, 2, 3}|.

Note that all fields must be specified.  So if you are using multidimentional
arrays you have to do some typing:
\begin{lstlisting}
a := [2][2]int{ [2]int{1,2}, [2]int{3,4} }
\end{lstlisting}
Which is \emph{not} the same as:
\begin{lstlisting}
a := [2][2]int{ []int{1,2}, []int{3,4} }
\end{lstlisting}
As this gives a compile error.\draft{why?}\newline
\lstinline{cannot use slice literal (type []int) as type [2]int in array index}

But this is then OK again:
\begin{lstlisting}
a := [][]int{ []int{1,2}, []int{3,4} }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Slices}

\begin{figure}[!bh]
\caption{Array versus slice}
\label{fig:array-vs-slice}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{fig/array-vs-slice.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:array-vs-slice} depicts the following Go code.
First we create an array of $m$ elements of the type \lstinline{int}:
\lstinline{var array[m + 1]int}\newline
Next, we create a slice from this array: 
\lstinline{slice := array[0:n +1]}\newline
And now is: \lstinline{len(slice) = n, cap(slice) = m} and
\lstinline{len(array) = cap(array) = m}.\newline
Also see listing \ref{src:arrays} below.

Slices are reference types, which means that if you assign one slice to
another, both refer to the same underlying array. For instance, if a
function takes a slice argument, changes it makes to the elements of the
slice will be visible to the caller, analogous to passing a pointer to
the underlying array. A Read function can therefore accept a slice
argument rather than a pointer and a count; the length within the slice
sets an upper limit of how much data to read. Here is the signature of
the Read method of the File type in package os:

The following code 
\lstinputlisting[label=src:arrays,caption=Arrays and slices]{src/array-and-slices.go}

See \ref{fig:array-vs-slice} for the details of \func{len()} and
\func{cap()} for arrays and slices.

show 
array cap 100 len 100, slice cap 100 len 100
On line 6 we declare an array of length 100, the elements are of
type \type{int} and the are indexed from 0 to 99. The capacity
and length are both 100. Then, on the following line, we create
a slice that points to the array, we \emph{slice} the array to
99 elements (indexed from 0 to 98). The capacity of the slice
is 99 and so is its length. 
\draft{Set length afterwards?}

On line 10 we dare to do to impossible and try to allocate something
behind the capacity (maximum length of the under laying array) and
we are greeted with a \emph{runtime} error 'throw: index out of range'.

\subsection{Maps}
