\label{ex:doc}
\Question
Go's documentation can be read with the \prog{godoc}. 

\prog{godoc hash} gives information about the \package{hash} package. Reading the
documentation on \package{container} gives the following result:
\vskip\baselineskip
\begin{display}
SUBDIRECTORIES

heap
list
ring
vector
\end{display}
\vskip\baselineskip
With which \prog{godoc} command can you read the documentation of \package{vector} contained in
\package{container}?

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question
The package \package{vector} is in a \emph{subdirectory} of
\package{container}, so you'll only need\quad \texttt{godoc
container/vector}.

Also specific functions inside a "manual page" can also be accessed. For
instance the function \func{Printf} is described in \package{fmt}, but to
only view the documentation concerning this function \prog{godoc fmt
Printf} is required.
\end{Answer}
